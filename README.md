NOTE:
Recommended profile to managing X gateways : (bx2-4x16 = 5GW's), (mx2-4x32 = 10GW's), (mx2-8x64 = 25GW's), (mx2-16x128 = 50GW's)
Please contact Check Point for assistance managing environments with larger than 50GW's
Performance can be limited by the network bandwidth allocated to the profile by IBM Cloud
